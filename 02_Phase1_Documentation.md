# Phase 1: Problem Understanding & Industry Analysis
## 1. Problem Statement

In many organizations, managing employee leave requests is still a manual or semi-automated process. Employees rely on emails, spreadsheets, or informal communication with managers to apply for leave. This leads to challenges such as:
- Lack of centralized leave records.
- Delays in leave approvals due to manual follow-ups.
- No visibility for managers into team leave schedules, affecting workforce planning.
- HR teams spending extra effort reconciling attendance, payroll, and leave balances.
- The Leave Tracker Project aims to provide a Salesforce-based CRM solution to streamline leave management, ensure transparency, and improve productivity.

## 2. Requirement Gathering
Functional Requirements
- Employees should be able to submit leave requests through a self-service portal.
- Managers should be able to review, approve, or reject leave requests.
- Employees should get notifications (email/SMS) when their leave is approved or rejected.
- System should track leave balances (e.g., sick leave, casual leave, earned leave).
- HR/Admin should have reports on leave utilization, employee trends, and pending approvals.
- Integration with employee data for role-based access.

Non-Functional Requirements

- Data Security: Only employees and managers can access their relevant data.
- Performance: Leave requests and approvals should be processed instantly.
- Usability: Simple interface for employees, managers, and HR.
- Scalability: Supports organizations of different sizes (small teams to large enterprises).

## 3. Business Process Mapping

- Step 1: Employee logs in and submits a leave request.
- Step 2: System checks leave balance and policy compliance.
- Step 3: Leave request is routed to the reporting manager.
- Step 4: Manager approves/rejects the request.
- Step 5: Employee gets notified (Email/SMS).
- Step 6: HR/Admin dashboard updates automatically with status and leave balance.

## 4. Industry-Specific Use Case Analysis

- Corporate/IT Companies: Streamlined leave approval process avoids project delays.
- Educational Institutions: Staff and faculty leave can be centrally managed.
- Manufacturing/Retail: Shift planning and workforce availability are improved.
- Technology/CRM Industry: Salesforce provides automation (Flows, Approval Processes) and reporting for HR operations.
- This project combines HR Tech + CRM automation use cases.

## 5. AppExchange Exploration

Before custom development, we explored Salesforce AppExchange to check for existing solutions:
- HR Management Apps: Mostly focus on payroll and performance management.
- Attendance/Leave Apps: Available but often too generic, expensive, or not customizable.
- SMB Solutions: Not scalable for enterprise-level needs.

ðŸ‘‰ Conclusion: Existing apps do not fully align with the organizationâ€™s specific leave policies and reporting needs. A custom Salesforce solution is required.

## 6. Phase 1 Outcomes

Problem clearly defined: Manual and inefficient leave management process.
- Requirements documented (functional + non-functional).
- Stakeholders identified and analyzed.
- Business process mapped for end-to-end leave cycle.
- Industry gap validated: AppExchange does not offer an exact fit.
