## Problem Statement

In many organizations, leave management is still handled manually using spreadsheets, emails, or paper requests. This creates multiple challenges:

- Employees lack visibility into their leave status and approval progress.
- Managers often miss or delay approvals due to lack of reminders.
- HR teams find it difficult to track leave balances, trends, and records centrally.
- Communication regarding approvals or rejections is not automated, leading to confusion.
- There is no single system where employees can view their past or pending leave requests.

The company wants a Salesforce CRM solution to:
- Provide employees with a self-service portal to raise leave requests.
- Automate the approval/rejection process with manager comments.
- Send real-time notifications (Email/SMS) to employees on status updates.
- Maintain a centralized leave history for compliance and reporting.
- Enable HR and managers to analyze leave trends and ensure workforce availability.

## Use Cases
